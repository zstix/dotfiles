## Dotfiles
This is _very much_ a work in progress.

### How to use
1. Clone this repository down
2. run `ln -s [REPOLOCATION]/[FILE]` for the desired configs
3. Create a `~/.local_[FILE]` for each file that needs device-specific overrides
4. For vim, install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and run `:PlugInstall`
5. Create a directory for vim's swapfiles at `~/.tmp-swp`
